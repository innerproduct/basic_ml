# Extensions of Vicsek model

* Particles on a torus (k-dimensional): direction = preference.
* Particles in a box (non-reflective walls): position = preference.
* Different ways of averaging: arithmetic average. Component-wise medians. Non-independent components. Different groups of particles having different averaging methods for different components: sensitive to consensus on some components, insensitive on others; sensitive only to in-group or a subset of groups. Again, complex relationships between which components change based on which group, for each group.
* Large number of components, but only a few important components for each group.

# Markov chains as conversion attribution models?

* Ad events are nodes (probably not good enough - since a node doesn't encode all history - but worth a try).
* Richer states, encoding ad event histories, perhaps time-boxed. Perhaps also including creative quality, or having a bigger time box for "better" or more engaging creatives.

# Addictions: processed foods are hyperpalatable (extremely tasty); they make ordinary and nutritious food seem boring by comparison. They also encourage over-consumption. Online media, similarly, is hyper-stimulative. The analogy works. Tghis is why people stare at their screens. It beats reality. How do they do it? They tap into a reward system which evolved in a different environment. What's the common design for this tapping? Remove the boring fiber or things which slow down the absorption of the exciting stuff. Consider the similarities with addictive drugs. And also note the differences: modern life isn't acutely toxic -- it won't kill you in the short term.
